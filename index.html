            The Captive-Bred Ocellaris Clownfish is very hardy and more
            accustomed to conditions found in home aquariums. Therefore, it
            makes a great choice for novices and seasoned aquarists alike. The
            Captive-Bred Ocellaris Clownfish can also be kept with a variety of
            other captive-bred clownfish, if introduced into the aquarium at the
            same time.

            Its overall body coloration is a shimmering silver, highlighted with
            pearly white spots. Bold, black stripes along the body accentuate
            the long fins to elegant effect. The Banggai Cardinal is relatively
            easy to breed in the aquarium setting. Once spawning has occurred,
            the male carries the eggs in his mouth to protect them.

            The Firefish Goby is also heralded as a sweet-tempered fish with
            lots of personality. In the wild, the Firefish Goby is usually found
            in groups hovering over the reef, harvesting planktonic food that
            drifts by in the current. The docile, Firefish Goby is timid and in
            the wild, each will have a "bolt-hole" into which it quickly ducks
            when threatened.
